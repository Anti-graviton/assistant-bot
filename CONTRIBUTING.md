## Getting Started

We maintain a list of things we would like to add to this project or aspects of it we would like to fix or improve.  If you just want to get involved and not sure where to start, take a look at [ehancements](https://github.com/Anti-graviton/assistant-bot/labels/enhancement) for ideas. Picking one of those up would be amazing and much appreciated!
